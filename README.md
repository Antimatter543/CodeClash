## AWS Backend Stuff
- Run the docker for judge0 execution
- From `cd CodeClash`, do `python3 aws_backend/app.py` to run the flask app.
- To use testscript, change the LOCAL variable depending on if you're using a server or hosting app locally, and then `python3 aws_backend/testscript.py` from the CodeClash directory.
